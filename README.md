# Callout
An app to automatically reach out to your friends or family while in need

There are times where you feel lonely and sad and also lost and broken, this app will try and rectify that problem by reaching out to people for you when you are looking for someone to talk to or vent

### Why this?
* Sometimes scared to talk to one person and wait for a text back from one single person
* Can have people looking out for you
* Show you that help is really one tap away

## Features:
* SMS Lookup of contacts (not yet functional)
* TBD...

## TODO:
* Works properly
* Custom contacts from personal contact list
* SMS/MMS/Some messaging services
* Tons of other things to help

#### This is a personal project of mine and I am very new to the Android dev environment, but hopefully this will become a working and helpful product to whoever uses it
