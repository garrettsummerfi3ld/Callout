# How to contribute

This project cannot be simply done alone, and I personally welcome changes, additions, or even removals of bloated parts of this project. Here is how to do it just to make it in

    1. Fork it 
    2. Play around with it
    3. Make changes
    4. Create Pull Request
    5. We will review it and it will either be merged or not merged.

If you need further guidance, you can find our team on the following:

* Personal Email (garrettsummerfi3ld@gmail.com)
* Discord

Please note we have a [code of conduct](#CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting started

Core functionality of the SMS and contact lookup are to not be removed by any chance, but only improved. Location requests are going to be implemented soon. Play around with it and if I like what I see in your pull request then it will be merged with our master branch.

For further guidance about getting started, please refer to the related links:

* [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* [Issues Guidelines](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

> **ProTip:** It's important people know the rules for contributing in the project. It's irritating for people trying to help when they are pushed back because they didn't follow some process that they didn't know existed. This file is the place for these processes and it will lower the barrier to entry for contribution.
